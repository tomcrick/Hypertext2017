TITLE: Engagement and Interactions of Language Communities on Twitter

----------- Review -----------
The article demonstrated the engagement and interaction of language communities on Twitter in the event of Baltimore protests. It used network graph to visualize the node degrees. I have following comments.

1. For figure 5, dose the size of node represent the weighted in degree and color represent outdgree?  What does the link between nodes represent?

2. Aside from visualization, the authors may consider doing some hypothesis testing to see whether the engagement and interactions have any significant results.

3. In the conclusion, the authors should explain how to fine-tuned to detect users with high closeness scores.

----------- Review -----------
The paper presents an analysis of Twitter users grouped by language based on their profile and statuses. Interactions between users from various language communities are examined. The data used is restricted to Twitter statuses which mentioned a hashtag associated with the Baltimore protests.

While the paper does introduce some interesting ideas in terms of language communities and their interactions, there are several problems with the paper:

1) There is no novel methodology introduced. Users are aggregated according to profile and status languages and a basic analysis of original statuses (actions) and statuses which reference others (reactions) is performed.

2) The size of the non-English communities are so small, it's not clear what the point of performing the analysis on this data is. It certainly is not convincing that there are any interesting patterns between the communities.

3) Intra-community interactions are ignored as the focus of the paper is on inter-community interactions. However, the authors should show that inter-community interactions differ from intra-community interactions.

----------- Review -----------
This is an application paper which aims to study "language communities" in relation to relevant events on Twitter. By language communities, the authors mean groups of users that can be characterized based on two features: the language of a user's profile, and the language used in the authored tweets.
Using the Baltimore riots occurred in April 2015 as case in point, the authors present a few analytics to conclude that the event "was substantially localised".

I think an analysis based on the two language features, coupled with other geotagged indicators (when available), can be of support to several applications in social networks. However, this paper suffers from two major problems that affect  my recommendation to acceptance.
First, this paper lacks technical significance and depth. The analysis conducted by the authors is correct but naive, as it is limited to occurrence analysis of cases related to languages and users.  
Figures 3-4 and Table 1 show the large predominance of English over other languages, which would make the entire study poor from a statistical significance viewpoint. As a consequence, most of the findings are intuitive and expected. Note also that Figures 3-4 are nearly unreadable --- they should be replaced by tables --- while the remaining figures are somehow illustrative but not much useful for the reader.

Related to the above problem is a serious issue of presentation. The Introduction is verbose and too long, and ultimately  fails to clearly state the presumed contributions. Section 3, which reports results of the analysis, should have been devised to first introduce and motivate the evaluation goals and to present a detailed workflow of corresponding actions subsequently discussed by the authors.

----------- Review -----------
The authors present a simple way to provide insight into the pattern of social networks interactions.
The topic is fashion and interesting, while the research look not so deep it is certainly a good starting point. For istance, it is not clear if there is a causality relating to the Baltimore protests to identify and categorise communities based only on the trend topic (which is the contribute of the others media such as TV, radio, and web site? How we state that twitter was fundamental?).

I think the approach presented in this paper may have some merit, but the results presented are not clear about how many it is really usable.
